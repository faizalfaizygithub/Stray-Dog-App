    'A community dog is a stray dog who is cared for by an individual or a bunch of people living in the area. The dog continues to live on the street and is not needlessly displaced elsewhere. At the same time it also receives care from like-minded people like you when necessary. By taking in a stray dog this way, you also prevent overcrowding in animal shelters.';

    'See that your community dog gets food at least twice a day and has enough water. You can share this responsibility with neighbours who are willing. If there is more than one dog, ensure that each dog gets enough food to prevent fighting. Build makeshift shelters from cardboard boxes, old furniture etc.';
